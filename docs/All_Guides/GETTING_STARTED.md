## 🎯 What is RustMT5?

**RustMT5** is an industrial-grade, type-safe Rust client library for interacting with **MetaTrader 5** terminals via high-performance **gRPC**. It eliminates complex C++ DLL wrappers and provides direct, reliable programmatic trading.

### 🌟 Key Advantages
- 🚀 **High Throughput**: Native gRPC streaming for sub-millisecond price ticks and trade execution.
- 🛡️ **Three-Layer Architecture**: Low-level gRPC (`MT5Account`), typed wrapper methods (`MT5Service`), and high-level convenience (`MT5Sugar`).
- 🔄 **Resilient Connection**: Auto-reconnect, exponential backoff, and transparent channel healing.
- 💼 **Production Ready**: Fully verified across institutional accounts, hedge fund systems, and automated retail bots.

## 📦 Installation

Install RustMT5 via your standard Rust package manager:

```bash
cargo add metarpc-mt5
```

## 🔑 API Key & Authentication

Connecting to MetaRPC production endpoints (`mt5.mrpc.pro:443`) requires an API key:

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account for free at [https://mrpc.pro/signup](https://mrpc.pro/signup).
2. **Generate API Key**: In your MetaRPC Portal dashboard at [https://mrpc.pro/my](https://mrpc.pro/my), go to **API Keys** to generate and copy your personal API token.
3. **Configure Connection**: Pass your API key / token along with the server address (`mt5.mrpc.pro:443`) in your connection settings.

## 🆔 Automatic Account ID & Authentication

MetaRPC endpoints require authentication and session management:
1. **`APIKey`**: Your personal authentication token from [https://mrpc.pro/my](https://mrpc.pro/my) (obtained by registering at [https://mrpc.pro/signup](https://mrpc.pro/signup)). Sent in the `APIKey` header.
2. **`id`**: A terminal session GUID returned by `Connect` / `ConnectEx` (`terminalInstanceGuid`).

> 💡 **Seamless Automation**: You do not need to call `GetId` or provide an `id` header when connecting. The server automatically generates a session GUID upon connection and returns it to the caller. The SDK automatically captures this session ID and attaches it alongside your `APIKey` to all subsequent requests and streaming subscriptions.

## 🔌 Minimal Connection Example

Here is how easy it is to initialize `MT5Account`, connect to your MetaTrader terminal, and retrieve your account balance:

```
let mut account = MT5Account::new(user, password, grpc_server);
account.connect_by_server_name(server_name, "EURUSD", 30).await?;
let summary = account.account_summary().await?;
println!("Balance: {}, Equity: {}", summary.account_balance, summary.account_equity);
```
