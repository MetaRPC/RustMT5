# Your First Project in 10 Minutes (Rust)

> **Hands-on Quick Start** - Create a working trading project with MetaTrader 5 and RustMT5 from scratch.

---

## Step 0: Obtain Your API Key

To connect to MetaRPC endpoints (`mt5.mrpc.pro:443`), obtain your API key:
1. Register for free at [https://mrpc.pro/signup](https://mrpc.pro/signup).
2. Generate your API token in your dashboard at [https://mrpc.pro/my](https://mrpc.pro/my).
3. Set your token in your environment or connection config.

## Step 1: Create Your Project

Create a new directory for your trading bot:

```bash
mkdir my_rustmt5_bot
cd my_rustmt5_bot
```

Install the package:

```bash
cargo add metarpc-mt5
```

---

## Step 2: Write Your Trading Code

Create your main application file and paste the following snippet:

```
use metarpc_mt5::MT5Account;

// Account ID generation (GetId) and authentication are handled automatically
let mut account = MT5Account::new(user, password, grpc_server, apiKey);
account.connect_by_server_name(server_name, "EURUSD", 30).await?;
let summary = account.account_summary().await?;
println!("Balance: {}, Equity: {}", summary.account_balance, summary.account_equity);
```

---

## Step 3: Run the Program

Run your application:

```bash
# Verify connection output
# Balance: 10000.00, Equity: 10000.00
```
